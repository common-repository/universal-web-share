= Will you be adding additional features? =
Yes, but the idea of the plugin is to keep things simple so you won't find major new features here.
= Which browsers support this feature? =
Currently Firefox does not support the Web Share API. [See browser compatibility here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share#browser_compatibility). If the browser does not support it, the share button will not appear.
